# **Titanic Dataset Analysis and Spam Message Classification**

**Titanic Dataset Analysis**


**The Context**

The RMS Titanic was a luxury British steamship that sank in the early hours of April,15 1912 after striking an iceberg leading to the deaths of more than 1500 passengers and crew. Of the 2240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1500 lost their lives in the disaster.



The following are what i'll use as my accountability to ensure success in my analysis:



Find out the circumstances one was in to survive the Titanic drown


Fit the models in the K-Nearest Neighbor model and obtain the best parameters for the model. I also want to obtain an accuracy of 85% in my model.



Get comprehensive evaluations and conclusion for my analysis.



I will be using the accuracy metric and f1 score to measure the performance of my model.



The steps taken during this study are:


1. The following steps will be undertaken during this study:



2. Reading and exploring the dataset.



3. Data Cleaning; Dealing with outliers, anomalies and missing data to answer the given question.



4. Perform univariate, bivariate analysis and multi-variate analysis and recording observations.



5. Checking for multi-collinearity.



6. Fitting my data into the K-Nearest Neighbors and obtaining the best parameters for the model.



7. Providing comprehensive recommendations based on my study.



8. Challenging my solution by providing insights on how to make model improvements.



**Project Description**

I will be using the K-Nearest Neighbors in my Titanic Dataset Analysis. Feature Reduction Techniques of the Linear Discriminant Analysis using a single component to improve the model performance. I will also try out different test sizes, which I found 10% is the optimal measure of the model which I scored 87% accuracy in prediction.


I challenged my model using the Random Forest Algorithm and scored an accuracy of 88% which also surpassed our metric of success.


**Spam Message Classification**



**The Context**

Given a number of variables, as a Data Scientist am tasked to correctly classify a spam message.


**Metrics of success**



I am targeting to achieving an accuracy of 85% with the optimal Naive Bayes Classifier model.


Steps taken during the study:


The following steps will be undertaken during this study:



1. Reading and exploring the dataset.




2. Data Cleaning; Dealing with missing data to answer the given question.



3. Perform univariate and multi-variate analysis and recording observations.



4. Fitting my data into the Naive Bayes Classifier and obtaining the best paramters for the model.



5. Providing comprehensive recommendations based on my study.



6. Challenging my solution by providing insights on how to make model improvements.



**Project Description**


I used the Naive Bayes Classifier model to correctly a spam message. Tuned the model, tested it using different test sizes.
